CookieBin is a small (2k minified) javascript library to store,
retrieve and delete cookies in the web browser. It is a stand alone
library, but can be used in conjunction with any javascript
framework.

Where JSON support is available, it allows the user to store
and retrieve complex objects or arrays using cookies.
